<p style="text-align: justify;">The best homemade Alfredo sauce recipe made from scratch with only a handful of natural ingredients. It&rsquo;s so easy, comes together in just minutes, and will knock your pasta socks off! Store-bought Alfredo doesn&rsquo;t even compare.<br /><br /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>What is Alfredo Sauce?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Alfredo Sauce is a rich, smooth and creamy white sauce perfect for serving with cooked pasta. Authentic Italian Alfredo sauce is typically made with Parmesan cheese, butter, some warm pasta cooking water, and salt. Over the years, it&rsquo;s been adapted to include heavy cream.<br /><br /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Alfredo Sauce Recipe Ingredients :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Most Alfredo sauces are made with only Parmesan cheese, butter, cream, and salt. But we took the liberty of adding in some garlic and extra seasonings to make it that much more delicious. This is the only recipe you will ever need! Here&rsquo;s the breakdown:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">1. <strong>Parmesan cheese :</strong> For optimal results, use real Parmigiano-Reggiano right off the block. Avoid those shaker-style containers or tubs filled with pre-shredded cheese. They don&rsquo;t melt properly, making your sauce grainy. And they simply don&rsquo;t taste nearly as good as fresh.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">2. <strong>Butter:</strong> Either unsalted or salted work great. If using salted butter, I recommended omitting the additional salt until you&rsquo;ve tasted the sauce and then add extra, if necessary.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">3. <strong>Heavy Cream :</strong> We use heavy whipping cream for the ultimate indulgence. This will give you the creamiest, richest results. Go big or go home, right? You certainly can use regular heavy cream, though, and it will still be wonderful! (See note below for lower-calorie options.)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">4. <strong>Garlic :</strong> We use a mix of garlic powder and fresh garlic, which we think is perfect. If you want a more subtle garlic flavor, you could cut back on one or the other.<br />Seasonings: Salt, pepper, and dried Italian seasoning. This trio of spices really takes the sauce up a level. Parmesan cheese is already salty, so we&rsquo;re only adding in a touch more.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><br /><strong>Ingredients :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">- 1/2 cup butter , cut into large cubes or slices.<br />- 2 cups heavy whipping cream.<br />- 1 clove garlic, minced.<br />- 3/4 teaspoon garlic powder.<br />- 3/4 teaspoon Italian Seasoning.<br />- 1/4 teaspoon Kosher salt (not table salt).<br />- 1/4 teaspoon pepper.<br />- 2 cups freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.<br /><br /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Instructions :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">1. Add the butter and cream to a large nonstick saute pan, over medium-low heat; whisk until butter has melted.<br />2. Add in the minced garlic, garlic powder, Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper; whisk until combined and smooth.<br />3. Bring to a gentle simmer (do not boil) and cook for 3-4 minutes, whisking constantly, until it starts to thicken.<br />4. Stir in the parmesan cheese just until melted and the sauce is smooth.<br />5. Take off the heat and toss with cooked fettuccine noodles (or your favorite pasta.) <br />(If the sauce isn't quite thick enough, allow it to stand for 2-3 minutes before tossing with the pasta.)</p>
